# jekyll-webpack

A simple opinionated boilerplate for Jekyll.

Typically you would `npm build` then upload the result to Amazon S3, Github pages, or an FTP server of your choosing.

## Why ?

Because using an additional tool for managing your dependencies (`.js`, `.css`, images, fonts...) seems like a nice improvement to the already awesome Jekyll.

## Usage

1. install ruby with devkit

2. `gem install jekyll`

3. `gem install bundler`

4. `gem install tzinfo-data`

5. `bundle update`

6. `npm install`

7. `npm start`

Simply use `npm start` or ` npm build`:

```sh
# Start Jekyll and Webpack in --watch mode
# Serve `_site/` with browser-sync → http://localhost:3000
npm start

# Build files → `_site/`
npm build

# Build files → `_site/` with --verbose
npm build:debug
```

If you have any problems, make sure you have `Bundler` and `Jekyll` installed (see this [quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/)) then clone the repo and `npm install`.
